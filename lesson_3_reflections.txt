When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I guess you want to use a remote repository for a  couple of situations, like when you want to share code with someone
or when you have a stable enough version of your code to make it public. Also I think it might be very helpful if you
are using more than one system to work on your project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If someone else made changes to the remote repository and Git automatically pulls changes, I guess this might override some of the things I changed locally. Also I think it might break my code because I maybe need to make adjustments to my code first before it will run with the newest version in the remote repository, but I don't want to do that all the time, only when I'm finished writing my code ... ?
