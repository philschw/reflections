What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository tells git that we want to create a repository in a certain place and tells git to track
those files


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area helps to break commits down into smaller parts. Without the staging area the only way to do a commit
would be by commiting all at once


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Since only files added to the staging area are being commited, there can't be any "accidental" commits
It is used to seperate the files to be commited from all the other files that have changed too.
